# Casque

Casque is a flexible layout system for positioning and aligning elements in both horizontal (row) and vertical (column) directions.

## Features

- **Row & Column Layouts**: Organize elements horizontally or vertically
- **Multiple Alignment Strategies**: Top, center, bottom, left, right, and anchor-based alignment
- **Anchor Points**: Define custom connection points for precise element alignment
- **Margin Support**: Built-in margin handling with intelligent overlap behavior
- **TypeScript First**: Fully typed API for excellent developer experience
- **Composable**: Nest rows and columns to create complex layouts

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { element, row, column } from "casque";

// Create elements
const box1 = element({ w: 100, h: 50 });
const box2 = element({ w: 100, h: 50 });

// Create a horizontal layout
const horizontalLayout = row({
  items: [box1, box2],
  align: "center",
});

// Create a vertical layout
const verticalLayout = column({
  items: [box1, box2],
  align: "left",
});
```

## Why Casque?

Casque was created to solve layout calculations for process diagrams and flowcharts, where elements need to be precisely positioned and aligned. It provides a declarative API for describing layouts while handling all the complex positioning math for you.

Unlike CSS-based layout systems, Casque gives you:

- **Precise coordinates**: Get exact x, y positions for every element
- **Anchor-based alignment**: Align elements at their logical connection points
- **Programmatic control**: Calculate layouts in JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Framework agnostic**: Use with React, Vue, Canvas, SVG, or any rendering system
